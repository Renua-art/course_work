# Node / Express JS REST API

## Introduction
## Project (Coursework 2 | Backend) done by renua copyright should be acknowledged
## This work was done to create a backend
## The db.js file connects with the mongodb
## The index.js file connects to the expressjs
## "get all lessons" -> gets lessons and order
## Because I am using Mongodb now and I don't want to outcode it, <br>
I'm getting the image from Mongodb but I can't directly insert the image from Mongodb, <br>
that's why I just used the bootstrap icon for my images.
